# The AMBER Workflow 
This is the standard way to prefrom an Amber simuation

## The system 
For this tutoral we will be using Alanine dipeptide. Alana dipeptide is just two Alaine Amino acids connected togethere. This system is a well know model system for protein since the small size of protein allows it to easliy sample differnet confromations, and combonations of phi and psi angles of the backbone.
